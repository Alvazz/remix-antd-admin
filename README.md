A management system based on `Remix/Antd/...`, which can quickly understand the performance of Remix as a management system.

tips: maybe this: `This Serverless Function has crashed.`

## Design motivation

Considering that Remix has an excellent design in the routing system, most of the background management system business is done in the routing. It may be a good choice to use Remix to complete the background management system. now, I currently lean more towards front-end development.
